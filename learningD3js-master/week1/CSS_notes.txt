#CSS notes

CSS goes in the <head><</head> section of the HTML document within <style></style> tags

OR ---

can mention a css file in the head like this:
<link rel = 'stylesheet' href='style.css' /> 

1. tag selectors
- use name of tag 
- for eg: 
HTML: <img src='logo.jpg'/>
CSS: img {...}

2. class selector
- use name of class

HTML: <p class = 'withborder'>...</p>
CSS: .withborder {...}


3. ID selector
HTML: <h1 id = 'page-title'>..</h1>
CSS: #page-title {...}


- difference between id and class is id has to be specific for every element whereas multiple elements can have the same class

4. pseudo selector
HTML: <button>OK</button>
CSS: button:hover {...}
-Select elements based on certain state
