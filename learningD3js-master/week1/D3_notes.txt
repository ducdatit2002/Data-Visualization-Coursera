#D3 notes

Visualization steps:
1. Transform Data
2. Map data to image space
3. Compute layout
4. Draw the chart

Each of these steps are executed by D3 APIs

1) Transform Data
d3.cross (cross multiplication), d3,max

2) Map Data to image Space
d3.scaleLinear

3) Compute layout
d3.path, d3.treemap

4) Draw the chart
d3.select, d3.append
